These are my personal Dot files. Feel free to use them as you see fit. If you have some suggestions on how to improve them, do send a PR and I will happily merge.

## Vim Setup
Install vim following the instruction [here](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) . Then symlink the vimrc file from this repo to `~/.vimrc`

## Tmux
For now ignore the tmux config in the file and go with [this one](https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux)
